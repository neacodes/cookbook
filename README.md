# Welcome to Sema4.ai Cookbook! üåü

## What's This All About?

The `cookbook` is a collection of examples, templates, and tutorials
designed to showcase the possibilities of the Sema4.ai AI Agents and [Actions](https://github.com/Sema4AI/actions).

## Project Status: Developer Preview

It's important to note that the Sema4.ai Action Server itself is in an open-source developer preview phase.
This means while you explore and contribute to the `cookbook`, you're also interacting with a platform
that's actively evolving.
